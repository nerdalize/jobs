Ever wondered why cloud providers make it such a hassle for you to migrate your stuff? Or why you're never quite sure what you're actually paying them for? Enter: [Nerdalize](https://www.nerdalize.com)! We build an [affordable, easy-to-use, and sustainable cloud](https://www.nerdalize.cloud) for large computational workloads by [placing high performance servers into homes as heating systems.](https://vimeo.com/122893200)

You can help us keep this promise to our customers because you live and breath the newest clustering technologies. Actually, you dream of your own rowing boat ship to call yourself Kubernetes. Docker has no secrets for you: you package containers like a freakin' magician.

You have a degree. Or not. Whatever. We love you because you can voice your strong opinion on anything both in English and Go. Oh, and we just love to read your Github account in the weekend for some inspiration and relaxation.
